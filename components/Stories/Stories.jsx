                  To overcome the challenges, the design team focused on
                  creating a clean, minimalist, and modern design that could
                  provide a seamless browsing experience for the customers. The
                  website was designed with a user-friendly interface that
                  allowed customers to easily navigate through the different
                  categories of Abayas, filter them by style, color, and size,
                  and view detailed product descriptions and images.

                      We started by analyzing the company business goals, target
                      audience, and competitors to understand their needs and
                      requirements. We then created a wireframe and design
                      concepts that would provide a better user experience and
                      make the website more engaging.
